# Coffee Machine Console Application

This repository contains a console-based Coffee Machine application developed in C#. The project originated as an exercise in my Python course, which I decided to enhance and reimplement in C# to deepen my understanding of the language and its features.

## Overview

The Coffee Machine application simulates a coffee ordering system where users can select from a variety of coffee types, input the amount of money they wish to use, and receive change if applicable. The program manages the ingredients and calculates costs, providing a simple yet effective user experience.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface:** The application presents a clear and intuitive menu for coffee selection.
- **Ingredient Management:** Tracks the available ingredients and alerts users if they are insufficient for a selected coffee.
- **Order Processing:** Calculates total cost and accepts user input for payment.
- **Dynamic Reporting:** Allows users to generate a report on remaining ingredients and total sales.
- **Reusability:** Built with modular components to facilitate easy updates and feature additions.
